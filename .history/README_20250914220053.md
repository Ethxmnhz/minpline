Mobile-first React + TypeScript single-page app (no backend) for logging meals, tracking macros & workouts, and saving meal templates for quick add. Data is persisted in localStorage only (private to your browser).

## Features
- Daily meals logging (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
- Workout logging (type + calories burned)
- Saved meal templates (quick add to today)
- Goals (calories + macros) editable in Settings
- Dashboard with progress bars (net calories subtracting workout calories)
- Mobile nav bar / responsive layout
- Local persistence with Zustand + persist middleware

## Tech Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Zustand for state management
- date-fns for date helpers

## Development
Install dependencies and start dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Data Model
See `src/types.ts` for TypeScript interfaces.

Store key: `tracker-store-v1` in `localStorage`.

## Future Ideas
- Macro auto-calculation from ingredients
- Import/export JSON
- Streaks & charts
- PWA offline caching & install banner
- Dark/light theme toggle
